 in will have to parse out the year because it does not matter.
 * Percent Change and Year are Float objects
 * Outlier Year is the year where during that time period the stock had an opposite 
 price change. If Outlier Year is a NaN value, then the stock had 100% positive or negative price
 change during that time period.
